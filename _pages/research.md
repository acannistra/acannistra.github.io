### Current Projects:
*   Implications of seasonality and changing environment to fitness in insects.
*   Getting used to graduate school!

### My Work:

My research aims to use a wide range of heterogeneous data sources coupled with machine learning approaches to predict the responses of biological organisms and whole ecosystems to climate change.

I work to enhance the quality and resolution of these predictions and to increase the ease of use, transparency, and adaptability of this research to propel scientific discovery in the field. 

I am a member of the Big Data/Data Science [IGERT traineeship](http://escience.washington.edu/education/phd/igert-in-big-data-and-data-science/) through the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu) at the University of Washington.
