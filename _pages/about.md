I'm Tony, a graduate student in the [Biology department](http://www.biology.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu). I'm also a Data Science Fellow at UW's [eScience institute](http://escience.washington/edu). I use techniques from data science to better predict biological responses to climate change in the [Buckley lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley). I graduated [Tufts University](http://www.tufts.edu) in Medford, MA in 2015, where I got my B.S. in Computer Science and Biology. 

I live in Seattle, Washington. I'm an outdoor enthusiast and naturalist. I like to run, ski, hike, backpack, and climb high peaks. I'm from [Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_island), and I have lived in [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado) and [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville,_Massachusetts).
