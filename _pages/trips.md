I'm trying to write down informaiton about all the interesting outdoor adventures I have, so they're easy to revisit and share. Below should be an embedded Google spreadsheet with this information. If you're curious about any of the trips (or want to go on one with me), e-mail me at [tony.cannistra@gmail.com](mailto:tony.cannistra@gmail.com). You can see the full sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GXsjSZoP8t_L9JXKqVlN13zkT0smLhWqKHKPcRnokFQ/pubhtml) too. 

In addition, I've begun to compile classic PNW trail running destinations (and maps of the locales) [here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/-Trail-Running-in-Seattle-EEAk5gjq3iHBAdMrSlU4T).
