My current work focuses on building highly performant geospatial data processing and delivery systems for a leading outdoor recreation mapping company, onXmaps. I also provide geospatial analytics consulting and cartography services via [Cascade Cartographics](https://cascadecarto.org).

I enjoy scientific research at the myriad intersections of ecology, climate change, earth science, social science, and public policy. ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qmp_x2MAAAAJ&hl=en))

Time away from my desk is most often spent on trails or snow in Washington or Colorado. In addition, I try to stay involved in outdoor education, with a recent focus on avalanche safety education. ([NWAC](https://nwac.us))
