name: "<i class='icon-briefcase'></i> TuftsLife v3"
language: HTML/CSS/Python-Django
purpose: |
 The Tufts University community has long relied upon a student-run web site known as [TuftsLife](http://www.tuftslife.com), which is a portal for sharing events and classified listings pertinent to Tufts students. The site underwent a recent redesign that left the campus wanting, so myself and Tufts junior Tara Kola have undertaken the task of managing a team of ~10 excited Tufts students in the rebuilding of the site from the ground up. We hope to release TuftsLife v3 in the beginning of Fall 2014.
outcome: |
 Project ongoing. 
code: none available.
completed: in progress
