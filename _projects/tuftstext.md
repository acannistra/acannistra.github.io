name: "<i class='icon-home'></i> TuftsText / CollegiateText"
language: Python/HTML/CSS/SQL
purpose: |
 When I arrived at Tufts, I was a frequent user of a textbook price comparison service called [GetchaBooks](http://www.getchabooks.com), created by Tufts students. This winter, when the students who created the website decided to take it down, my friend [James](http://www.facebook.com/james.roseman) and I picked up where they left off.
outcome: |
  The GetchaBooks people made their code open-source, so we simply had to install their Git repo onto a properly-configured server, change some CSS colors, and behold: [TuftsText](http://www.tuftstext.com). The site worked great during the Spring semester, and drove quite a bit of traffic. However, once Tufts changed the software used by the university to manage courses and registration, much of the infrastructure upon which GetchaBooks/TuftsText is based no longer works. So, James and I are working on rebuilding TuftsText from the ground up and are planning on expanding to two other area universities, Bentley and Brandeis. 
code: not yet available
completed: Spring 2013
