name: "<i class='icon-briefcase'></i> Tufts Idea Exchange 2014"
language: English
purpose: | 
 The Tufts Idea Exchange is a TED-style forum in the spring of each academic year. Each year we invite undergraduates to apply to share their "big idea" with the campus in the form of an 8-minute presentation. We also invite a faculty member and some Tufts alumni/ae to share their experiences as well. As co-President this semester (along with sophomore [Kit McDonnell](https://www.facebook.com/kit.mcdonnell)), I am jointly responsible for leading the TEX team, a group of Tufts undergrads who read the 30-plus student applications, interview some, and select the 6 or 7 student speakers. We then coach those students for a month or so prior to the event to ensure their creative ideas are showcased brilliantly on stage in April.

outcome: |
 The event went off to a full house, and the presentations were exceptional. Read about it in the [Tufts Daily](http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/view.php/659568/Students-host-annual-Tufts-Idea-Exchange)
