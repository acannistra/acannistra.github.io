name: "<i class='icon-briefcase'></i> COMP167: SNP Calling Analysis"
language: "Python"
purpose: |
  To analyze the results of a SNP-calling program, in the form of <code>.vcf</code> files, and compute statistics about the data. The data were also compared against a database of known SNPs (dbSNP, csomes 18-21) to find "novel" variants.
outcome: |
  Determined:
  			<ul>
  				<li>Novel SNPs, passing</li>
  				<li>Novel SNPs, filtered</li>
  				<li>Known SNPs, passing</li>
  				<li>Known SNPs, filtered</li>
  				<li>Ti/Tv ratios for the above sets</li>
  				<li>% passing SNPs that are known</li>
  			</ul>
  		Among other statistics.
