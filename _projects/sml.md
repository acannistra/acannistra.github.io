name: "<i class='icon-briefcase'></i> COMP105: Standard ML Type Inference"
language: "Standard ML"
purpose: |
 To add a SML-like type inference system to a "micro-ML" (type-free) interpreter
outcome: |
  This project was completed by using a <b>constraint-solving</b> inference algorithm, where type expressions are distilled into <b>type constraints</b> (similar in style to a CNF boolean solver), and solved.<p>In short, we were able to take a non-typed language and convert it to a strictly typed one via the addition of a type inference system. I later served as a teaching assistant for the course in which this topic was taught.</p>
