language: HTML/CSS/Javascript
purpose: |
 The Tufts Mountain Club is an awesome organization, and its members lead amazing trips all over New England. For my first two years at Tufts, though, the only way to find out what trips were happening was to go onto the [TMC Website](http://www.tuftsmountainclub.org/trips-2) and look at an ugly table. So I decided to do something about it and make a new interface. Unfortunately, due to changes in the API, the site currently needs some refactoring to get it up and running again, but all the code is available on GitHub.
outcome: |
 I built a frontend and a small node.js backend. You can see all of the code and some documentation on [github](http://www.github.com/acannistra/trips).
code: "[github](http://www.github.com/acannistra/trips)"
completed: Spring 2013
