name: "<i class='icon-home'></i> This website!"
language: HTML/CSS/[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
purpose: |
 To create a simple personal website that can be easily and quickly updated. I was looking for a nice way to be able to write my site in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
outcome: | 
 The site is very much a work in progress, but the implementation is quite enjoyable to work with. My desire for a clean Markdown-based site and a database-free content management system brought me to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). GitHub runs the markdown through Jekyll, which supports the [Liquid Template Engine](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers), which is small and simple to use. All of the projects on this page, for example, are encoded in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) format, parsed by Liquid into the tables you see.
code: On [GitHub](http://www.github.com/acannistra/acannistra.github.io).
completed: ongoing.
