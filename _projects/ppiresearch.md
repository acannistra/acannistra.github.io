 <i class='icon-briefcase'></i> Protein Function Prediction Research
language: Python
purpose: |
 My first foray into research combining my interests in Biology and Computer Science, this project is an ongoing attempt to improve the accuracy of computational protein function prediction based on work Tufts University computer science Profs. [Ben Hescott](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~hescott) and [Lenore Cowen](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~cowen) have been doing over the past year. Hescott and Cowen have developed a protein-protein interaction network distance metric called the Diffusion State Distance (paper forthcoming, PLOS ONE Fall 2013). The DSD metric has produced good results when operating on networks of *physical* protein-protein interaction data. My charge for the summer, together with Tufts senior Inbar Fried, was to integrate *genetic* protein-protein interaction data. 
outcome: | 
 Since this research has not yet been published, I'm not at liberty to discuss results. However, they are quite interesting. Look for a potential presentation at [RECOMB 2014](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/recomb/). 
code: not available (yet)
completed: ongoing
