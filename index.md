I'm a student at Tufts University in Medford, MA, studying [Computer Science](http://www.cs.tufts.edu) and [Biology](http://ase.tufts.edu/biology), graduating in [2015](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015). I'm interested in computational biology, software engineering, and design. I also enjoy [nature](http://www.tuftsmountainclub.org), [reading](http://www.goodreads.com/tonycannistra), and [food](http://blog.anthonycannistra.com/tagged/food).
